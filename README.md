🌟 **Creating AI-Powered Executive Summaries for Tech Summits** 🚀

In Solution Architect role, staying ahead of the ever-evolving tech landscape is mission-critical. One of the best ways to stay current is by attending industry-defining events like the **Databricks Data + AI Summit**, **Snowflake Summit**, **AWS Summit**, **KubeCon + CloudNativeCon** etc— either in person or virtually.

But what if you can't attend any or all of them? That's where AI steps in. 🤖

I recently **prototyped a Multi AI Agent System** capable of generating **Executive Summaries** for major tech events, capturing:

* 🎉 **Product Launches**
* 🚧 **Key Announcements**
* 📈 **Strategic Implications**
* 📄 **M\&A Developments**

### 🌐 System Architecture:

Built using the **CrewAI framework**, this system utilizes a team of 3 autonomous agents:

1. **Technical Content Planner**
2. **Technical Content Writer**
3. **Technical Content Editor**

These agents use below tools:

* ⚖️ **SerperDev Tool** (search and retrieval)
* 📋 **ScrapeWebsite Tool** (content extraction)

### 🔍 Inputs to the System:

```json
{
  "topic": "Snowflake Summit",
  "current_year": "2025",
  "format": "html",
  "audience": "Data and AI leaders interested in the latest trends and innovations",
  "area": "Data and AI"
}
```

### 📊 Results:

The system generated detailed reports summarizing key takeaways from:

* [🌨️ Snowflake Summit 2025](#)
* [📈 Databricks Data + AI Summit 2025](#)

🌟 The results are **promising**, though there's still room for enhancement.

This experiment affirms the **potential of AI agents** and if you're building systems like this , I'd love to connect! 🧐
